<h2 class="sub-heads">Classroom policies</h2>
<ol class="lines">
<li>Come prepared to class with any materials (assignments, quizzes, worksheets, etc.) that are due filed on time.</li> 
<li>Cheating, plagiarism and/or fabrication of any assignment or element of that assignment will result in automatic failure of the course and a recommendation to the University Disciplinary Committee for further disciplinary action.</li> 
<li>Failing to turn in an assignment on the designated day and time will result in severe penalty on your grade (immediate deduction of 30 points) and exhibits a lack of dedication to the class. You have until the next class to turn in late work (highest possible grade is 70). After that, no late work accepted.</li>
<li>Attendance policy: Journalists are driven by deadlines therefore it is imperative that you arrive at class on time. Attendance is expected. If you must miss a class, please let me know prior to the start of class via email or text message. Please note: it is your responsibility to make up any missed work, notes, etc. Treat the class like a job -- would you really not show up without notice?</li>
<li>In-class writing assignments or quizzes mean just that -- you must be in class for the assignment or quiz. Otherwise, you do not get credit or the benefit of my review. If you let me know ahead of time that you won't be there and have a valid reason, I'll allow you to make the work up.</li>
<li> <strong>*IMPORTANT: I run this class like a newsroom. Behavior that is not acceptable in the business world is it not acceptable in this classroom. </strong></li>
<li> <strong>Absolutely no cell phone use during class. </strong>If you use a laptop to take notes, then you should be taking notes, not cruising the Internet or doing other assignments.</li>
